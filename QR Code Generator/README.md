# QR Code Generator


Generate QR Code with Tkinter GUI and save the QR Code into the Local Directory (cwd).
The project utilises `pyqrcode` and `png` module in python to generate QR code of any text. 
The Tkinter Entry field takes the value and store it in a variable which is then converted to Image Code.
